## BETA and Experimental: WordPress 6.0-ready anti-theme 

Lesspress WordPres Theme eliminates almost everything that sucks for speed in common WordPress themes and is built so that sites do not inherently add back in all the stuff that sucks via plugins. It was built for blogs and publishers who rarely understand how they make their sites slow with just about every addition, settings change, etc. inside WordPress. 

Lesspress is built for the new Full Site Editing experience. Please note that the Source files are only recommended for those looking for an experiment. This is a personal pet project and not something that is currently maintained or developed by an experienced development team **_Don't_ expect a bug_free WordPress Theme!**

If you want to see it in action or want to download it,
