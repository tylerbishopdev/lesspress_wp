## Lesspress - fast theme.

Lesspress WordPres Theme eliminates almost everything that sucks for speed in common WordPress themes and is built so that sites do not inherently add back in all the stuff that sucks via plugins. It was built for blogs and publishers who rarely understand how they make their sites slow with just about every addition, settings change, etc. inside WordPress.

## Please don't ruin my beautiful theme with plugins.

=======
Lesspress is built for the new Full Site Editing experience. Please note that the Source files are only recommended for those looking for an experiment. This is a personal pet project and not something that is currently maintained or developed by an experienced development team **_Don't_ expect a bug_free WordPress Theme!**

If you want to see it in action or want to download it, 

## What's included?

* Lesspress anti-Theme (works like regular theme only better)
* Full Site Editing config: Templates, Template parts, theme.json and Sass Source files
* Webpack configured for simplicity
* 2 Menus that are cool

## What's coming ... probably???

building theme configs that are super-duper fast like this theme here (not yet available).

## Tech stuff u might wanna know
Webpack, Sass, node.js ( npm install required for task automation)
=======
