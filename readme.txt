XYZ is missing. Should I add plugins to add what I need?

No. Please don't. Anything you add as a plugin to "design" or alter anything a visitor will see or load will make your site far slower

Why is my site slow even though I use this theme?

Site scores for this theme are 100/100 or 99/100 in lab data tests on local hosts and with field data on virtual cloud hosts of all shapes and kinds. It also hits these same scores running ads via Ezoic. If your site is slow, I recommend Ezoic Leap to see why. It will show you what you added to make it slow.
